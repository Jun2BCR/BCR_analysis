# BCR_analysis
We can generate the somatic hypermutation (SHM) matrices and plot the dataset with a beautiful bar plot.
This script can also be applied to other genes for mutation analysis.
This script is mainly for deep sequencing dataset with unique molecular identifiers (UMI).
When using this script, we need to firstly generate the SHM matrices by comparing the clean dataset with the consensus.
Then using the generated the matrices, we can plot a barplot with mutation pattern and mutation rate.
